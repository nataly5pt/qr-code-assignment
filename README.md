## 🧩 Part 1 – Approach

For Part 1, I created a centered layout using Flexbox to keep the QR card vertically and horizontally centered on the screen. I followed the provided style guide for colors, font sizing, spacing, and image dimensions. The QR image was resized to 288px by 288px as required. Media queries were used to ensure the design adapts properly on smaller screen sizes.

## 🧩 Part 2 – Approach

For Part 2, I duplicated the QR card design four times using an unordered list and list items. CSS Grid was applied to display the cards in a two-column layout on larger screens. A media query changes the layout to a single column when the screen width is less than 1000px, allowing vertical scrolling on smaller devices.
